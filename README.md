My name is Aleksandra Wolska. I am a student of Applied Computer Science at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology.
My interests include drawing, hitchhiking in the Balkans and the Eastern Bloc.
In programming, I became interested in web development, especially React + JavaScript, which I am cureently learning.
Thanks to my studies, I have a whole cross-section of code in different languages here.
