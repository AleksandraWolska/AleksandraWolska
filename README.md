Hello!
My name is Aleksandra Wolska. I'm a student of Applied Computer Science at Wroclaw's University of Technology.

About my frontend stuff....

I started my adventure with frontend while studying Architecture, where I became interested in designing websites.

Along with my artistic interests in drawing and photography, I was very satisfied with reconstructing my own graphic projects using CSS..

Due to a newly discovered hobby, I decided to change my studies to Applied Computer Science at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology to make my websites interactive and working as well as get to know main concepts of programming. There I spent my time learning Java, algorithms, design patterns and whole cross-section of informatics in several different languages.

As for web development, I have mastered HTML and CSS, got familiar with JavaScript and React, and constantly practicing other web technologies. . Below are the projects that I deployed, other are in the Github repositories
